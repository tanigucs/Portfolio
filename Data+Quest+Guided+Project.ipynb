This means that the revenue will depend on the number of users using the app. The app will first be developed for the Android market. If the app receives good response from users, it will be developed further. If the app becomes profitable after six months, it will receive an iOS port and put on the App Store. This project will help provide conclusions on what profile of app will help attract more users.\n",

In the case of the *navigation* genre, Waze and Google Maps accounts for nearly all the user ratings. The same goes for the *music*, *social networking* and *reference* genres; a few apps have a significant portion of the total number of ratings for that genre. This creates a problem since it may seem like a certain genre is popular when only a few of many apps are popular with the number of rating dropping significantly after the most popular apps. However, ignoring the most popular apps we can see that there are not as drastic differences between one app to the next in terms of the number of ratings.

So, while the Prime users will continue to use the Kindle app, people without a prime account may gravitate towards a completely free app. An app could be developed that allows users to download and read books or the app could have the books preloaded upon download. Furthermore, users will spend more time within the app allowing for more opportunities to display ads.  \n",

Although the genre is dominated by a few apps (namely the Bible and digitized dictionaries/thesauruses), they are incredibly unique compared to the video game encyclopedias that make up most of the genre. A possible app profile could be a collection of religious texts from religions around the world that could also incorporate an in-app dictionary so users can find the definition of a word without exiting the app. In addition to an app in the *reference* genre, a second choice could be in the *book* genre. The app could contain a collection of classic literature.

Although these apps are extremely popular, research into some of the apps reveal that they require users to purchase books in order to read them. Apps that do this include Google Play Books, Audible, and Amazon Kindle, the latter two also found in the Apple Store. Wattpad appears to be the only truly free popular book app. However, looking further into what the app offers is unlike other e-book apps in the Google Play Store. Wattpad is an app where amateur authors can submit their books for users to read. Although there are some professional works on the app, they appear to be limited. While these apps have many downloads, they may not have many users due to paywalls within the otherwise free apps."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we analysed data about the Apple Store and the Google Play Store to help select an app profile profitable in both stores. In our analysis, we found two profiles that could be a possible fit for the goal of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first app profile is a classic literature collection. The app would consist of a library of classic literature from the likes of Jane Austin, Mark Twain, and Charles Dickens to name a few. While similar apps appear on the Apple Store like Audible and Amazon Kindle, they are not truly free as they require users to subscribe to the service or pay for the books they want to read. While the same can be said for the same apps in the Google Play Store, it does not apply to all the book related apps. In order to compete with these apps, we suggest adding unique features that may include bookmarks, table of contents, dictionaries, a rating system, recommended books, and a 'read later' list. If the app shows good user response, additional content and features could be added such as additional books, a companion website to the app used for discussions lead by users, and translation of books into other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second app profile is a collection of religious text. Since most religious apps on the App Store and the Google Play Store are focused on only one religion, a collection would draw more users from across many religions. The collection could include religious text from the most common religions such as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Judaism. The features in the app would generally be the same as the aforementioned app. An additional feature unique to this app could include daily passages from preferred religion and accompanying texts in the form of popup notifications of the users’ phone. If the app shows good user response it could be developed further with translations into other languages."
